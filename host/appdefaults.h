 *
 *   FFXIGameFolder       the FINAL FANTASY XI folder (--game)
 *   FFXIServer           the sign-in screen's first-run server

 *   FFXIBackground       a picture in the bundle's Resources, behind the sign-in screen
 *   FFXIFullscreenSpace  1: full screen in a macOS Space of its own; 0: in place
 *   FFXINameplates       "fix" or "off": names over heads keep their 4:3 shape, or widen with the window
 *   FFXINameplateScale   "1.25", or "1x1.2" (across x down): the size of those names
 *   FFXIDrawDistance     "3", or "3x1.5" (world x characters): draw distance, times the game's
 *   FFXILod             "near" or "game": the world's most detailed models at every distance, or the game's pick
