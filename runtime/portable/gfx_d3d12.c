/* The graphics back end on Direct3D 12 (Windows x64): what gfx.h asks for, on one ID3D12Device.
 * The same design as gfx_metal.m, in D3D12's terms:
 *
 *   - Frames: one command list recording at a time, executed at Present (or when the CPU needs a
 *     result, or in chunks mid-frame so the GPU starts early); up to three frames in flight, each
 *     with its own command allocator and upload ring - vertex, index and uniform bytes are copied
 *     into the ring per draw, so the game may rewrite a buffer the moment a draw returns, as D3D
 *     lets it. One fence counts submissions; a resource remembers the submission that last used it.
 *   - Resource states: textures carry their state (whole resource) and transition on use; buffers
 *     decay to COMMON after every submission, so they are tracked per command list.
 *   - Binding: one root signature for everything - the uniforms (b0), the draw's texture and sampler
 *     heap indices as root constants (b1), the vertex streams as raw root SRVs (t0..t3), and the whole
 *     shader-visible heaps as unbounded Texture2D / TextureCube / sampler tables. A texture's SRV lives
 *     in the heap for its lifetime; a draw binds nothing but 16 indices.
 *   - Pipelines come from the generated HLSL (gfx_hlsl.c), compiled with D3DCompile (SM 5.1) and
 *     built off the game's thread, cached by key: shaders, blending, depth-stencil, rasterizer and
 *     topology type (D3D12 bakes all of them into the pipeline). Samplers are cached by key.
 *   - Clears are D3D12's own (with rectangles); the back buffer reaches the window through a flip
 *     swap chain on the SDL window, drawn scaled with the frame-rate overlay on top.
 *   - Textures are default-heap resources filled through the ring with CopyTextureRegion. Formats
 *     D3D12 has no sampled match for (the 16-bit color ones) are widened to BGRA8 on upload, as on
 *     Metal; the swizzled ones (X8R8G8B8, L8, A8L8) are SRV component mappings. */
